            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a candle maker, an insect sympathizer, a trash collector, a driver with a not-so-valid license,
                and an artist who doesn't call myself an artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a student at <strong>Boston University</strong> studying <strong>Sculpture</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong>,
                and people constantly think they misheard my major.
                A number of interests play parts in my life, my friends and family being some of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "About Me" I have ever written before are my University Application Essays and my Artist Statements,
                in which I explain why I am applying to higher education or what I am doing with my art.
                I hereby explain why I am here and what I am doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am here to experience another life and another part of the world.
                In 10 years this moment would be like a dream for me,
                and I will no longer be experiencing this place as an insider, just like before I came. I do sculpture,
                shape cardboard, shattered glass, and wax. I play games, and I make games. I code.
                I find meaning by identifying and representing objects with data.
                I set pointers to recall this moment and come back to this dream when I need to.
                I travel in time, and fetch the pieces of dreams in the palace I built,
                feeding them into an ever-going execution cycle.
                I manufacture, with my fetch-execute cycle, from my pieces of dreams and experiences,
                new dreams and experiences that have not happened before.
                I am thus, instead of an artist, a manufacturer of art, or whatever my products are called.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a piece of flesh on a set of bones. In the end, I am a writer.
                A writer means a variable or a recorder.
                I change things and record what has been changed; that is called a test. I am a tester with my writings.
